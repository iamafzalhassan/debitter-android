A native Android app, built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, that produces precisely aligned debit notes and container deposit refund letters for a freight forwarding and customs clearing business in Colombo. It replaces a manual Word-document workflow with a fast, form-driven flow that ends in a print-ready PDF.

Every piece of text on a generated document is editable in the app: the company header, document title, field labels, section headings, totals labels and signature caption. None of it is hardcoded in the renderer.

## Features

- **Debit notes** with a shipment header (date, bill-to customer, vessel or flight, customs entry, container, BL or AWB, voyage and consignment) and two charge sections, Statutory and Other, prefilled from built-in presets.
- **Charge rows** that can be added, renamed and edited freely. A row left at zero is simply omitted from the printed note.
- **Live totals**: sub total, advance received and final total, always computed and never typed. The advance is re-validated whenever the charges change, so the total can never go negative.
- **Container deposit refund letters** with a letterhead chosen from the customer directory, a shipping agent, and reference fields for container, BL, vessel, voyage and receipt numbers.
- **True-to-page preview** rendered from the actual PDF, then save to `Downloads/Debitter/Debit Notes/` or `Downloads/Debitter/Refund Letters/` or share through the system share sheet.
- **Recent documents**: every saved debit note and refund letter can be reopened, edited, re-exported or shared.
- **Customer and shipping agent directory** managed from Settings and seeded once from presets on first install.
- **No permissions and no network.** Everything stays on the device.
- **English only.** The interface is in English, with no other translations.

## Architecture

- **MVVM with unidirectional data flow.** `EditorViewModel` and `LetterViewModel` expose an immutable document as a `StateFlow`; screens send sealed events back through a single entry point.
- **State survives the process.** In-progress documents are kept in `SavedStateHandle`, so rotation or backgrounding never loses a half-written note.
- **A pure rendering layer.** `pdf/` depends only on `Canvas`, `Paint`, `PdfDocument` and `Typeface`; it imports no Compose, no ViewModel and no UI type. The one exception is `PdfExporter`, which holds the `Context` for file IO through `MediaStore` and `FileProvider` and is not part of the layout engine.
- **Layering rules.** Composables never touch presets or defaults directly, and `EditorViewModel` and `LetterViewModel` never import a Compose UI type or a `Context`.
- **No code generation.** No KAPT, no KSP and no serialization plugin; JSON is written by hand with `org.json`.

## How the PDF works

Both documents are laid out by a custom engine drawn directly on `Canvas` with Android's `PdfDocument`, with no third-party PDF library.

- **Both documents are A4 portrait** (595 × 842 pt) — debit notes on 34 pt margins, refund letters on 56 pt. Each has its own layout object, so one can never disturb the other.
- **One vertical rhythm.** Every band on the page is separated by the same gap, and a blank block collapses together with its gap.
- **Always exactly one page.** Neither generator can start a second one. A document too tall to fit is repainted on a smaller scale — vertical rhythm and type shrink together, margins, columns and hairlines stay put — until it fits, so the layout is only ever a photographic reduction of itself. A document that fits at full size, which is every realistic one, is rendered once and left alone.
- **Decimal-aligned money.** Amounts are right-aligned on a fixed x-position with tabular figures on every paint that draws digits, so every `.00` lands on the same vertical line.
- **One continuous table.** The charge sections and totals share a single opening rule, a filled band per section heading and one hairline between rows, so no divider is ever drawn twice.
- **A fixed label column** shared by both charge sections, so neither section can have a ragged label edge.
- **Top-aligned grid cells.** A one-line value beside a wrapped one sits on the wrapped value's first line.
- **Crisp hairlines** drawn on half-pixel-snapped coordinates.
- **Mixed-weight wrapping.** The refund letter body wraps runs of regular and bold text, keeping a bold word and its punctuation together.
- **Bundled SF Pro Display** typeface. The PDF uses Regular and Bold, resolved once on first export, and a font that fails to load is an error rather than a silent fallback to a system font. Medium is used by the UI only.

## How the money works

- **Money is `BigDecimal`**, never `Double` or `Float`, because customs duties run into the millions of rupees.
- **One formatter for UI and PDF.** A single `#,##0.00` formatter is shared by the editor and the renderer, so the two can never disagree. It is held in a `ThreadLocal`, because the PDF renders off the main thread while the totals recompose on it.

## Storage

- **SQLite through `SQLiteOpenHelper`**, with tables for recent notes, recent letters, customers and shipping agents.
- **Non-destructive migrations.** Each schema upgrade only creates a table that is missing, so it is safe to run again, and a downgrade leaves every table in place. No migration drops a saved document.
- **Tolerant decoding.** Saved documents are stored as hand-encoded JSON; a missing or malformed field falls back to its default, so an older record never crashes the list.
- **Saving without permissions.** Files go to the public Downloads folder through `MediaStore` on Android 10 and later, and to the app's own Downloads folder on older versions.
- **A self-pruning share cache.** Shared files are served through a `FileProvider`, and anything older than 24 hours is removed.

## Tech stack

| Area | Choice |
|---|---|
| Language | Kotlin 2.2, JDK 17 |
| UI | Jetpack Compose, Material 3 |
| Navigation | Navigation Compose |
| Lifecycle | AndroidX Lifecycle, ViewModel Compose, SavedStateHandle |
| PDF | `android.graphics.pdf.PdfDocument`, `PdfRenderer` |
| Persistence | SQLite (`SQLiteOpenHelper`), `org.json` |
| Files | MediaStore, FileProvider |
| Platform | Android 8.0 (API 26) and later, compile SDK 37 |

## Design system

Debitter shares one design system with two other apps of mine: warm paper surfaces, navy ink, and a dotted divider as the signature motif. Colours, spacing and typography are tokens in `ui/theme`, with SF Pro Display for all text and tabular figures on every amount. Shared components (`AppTextField`, `AmountField`, `AppButtons`, `AppSnackbar`, `SheetFrame`, `PresetSheet`, `PresetTile`, `SectionHeader`, `ExpandablePanel`, `DottedDivider`, `ActivityIndicator`) live in `ui/components`. Screens never use a raw colour or a bare measurement.

## Code conventions

- A strict member ordering convention for every Kotlin file: properties sorted by type tier, then type, then name; functions ordered by call order.
- No comments in source. Names, types and ordering carry the meaning.
- `.editorconfig` configures ktlint's `intellij_idea` style at a 240-column line width for the IDE; no ktlint plugin runs in the build.

## Building

**Requirements:** Android Studio with the Android SDK (compile SDK 37) and JDK 17.

- Open the project in Android Studio and run the `app` configuration, or run `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug`.
- For a signed release, add a `keystore.properties` file at the project root with `storeFile`, `storePassword`, `keyAlias` and `keyPassword`, then run `./gradlew :app:assembleRelease`.

## Testing

JUnit 4 tests live in `app/src/test/java`, mirroring the package of the code they cover:

- **`util/MoneyFormatTest`**: amounts group into thousands with two decimals and round half up, input is parsed and sanitised to one decimal point and two fraction digits, and formatting from eight threads at once always gives the same result.
- **`model/DebitNoteTest`**: the sub total counts only printable rows, and the total subtracts the advance.

Run them with `./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest`.

## Roadmap

- Enable R8 shrinking for release builds
- An editable document date
